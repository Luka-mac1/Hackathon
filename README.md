# Timeplanner application
The application is a simple timeplaner. It assignes tasks that user needs to do to 
available timeslots
 
User enters the tasks he/she needs to perform and gives each task a priority (higher 
number more important task)

User also enters timeslots he/she is available - user selects the date and the time in the day. 

There could be less/same/more timeslots selected than the number of entered tasks

User can keep adding tasks/timeslots

When all tasks nad timeslots are entered user submits work to sheduler which assigns available 
timeslots to tasks in order of priority
